 A Simple Web Page With a Ai text to text bot Based off of Llama2

im using the llama2 modle best for my hardware downloaded by ollama you
  you will get better performence based on how much ram your machine has

to use this you first need to download the correct ollama version for your os then in terminal run 
"ollama run llama2"
then terminate that proscess however works best 
   this is to download the modle so python can see it
then navigate to the main.py file and run it with python 3.11+
once you see that its running follow the printed instructions to see the web client for your brand new llm

This is by no means finished and am always willing to work on  it with you if you have suggestions
