  you will get better performence based on how much ram your machine has

first navigate to the main.py file and run it with python 3.11+
  the python automaticly installes all dependecys including the proper llm model for your hardwar config
once you see that its running follow the printed instructions to see the web client for your brand new llm

This is by no means finished and am always willing to work on  it with you if you have suggestions
